 Developing a process to build good prompts is the first step every Stable
 Diffusion < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/> user tackles.
 This article summarizes the process and techniques developed through
experimentations and other users’ inputs. The goal is to write down all I know
 about prompts so you can know them all in one place.

 Anatomy of a good prompt
 A good prompt needs to be detailed and specific. A good process is to look
 through a list of keyword categories and decide whether you want to use any of
 them.
 The keyword categories are
 1. Subject
 2. Medium
 3. Style
 4. Art-sharing website
 5. Resolution
 6. Additional details
 7. Color
 8. Lighting
 An extensive list of keywords from each category is available in the prompt
 generator <
 https://andrewongai.gumroad.com/l/stable_diffusion_prompt_generator> .
You can also find a short list here < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to
come-up-with-good-prompts-for-ai-image
generation/#Some_good_keywords_for_you> .
 You don’t have to include keywords from all categories. Treat them as a checklist to
 remind you what could be used.
 Let’s review each category and generate some images by adding keywords. I will
 use the Dreamshaper model < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/models/#DreamShaper> , an excellent model for beginners.
 To see the effect of the prompt alone, I won’t be using negative prompts for now.
 Don’t worry. We will study negative prompts in the later part of this article.
 All images are generated with 25 steps of DPM++ 2M Karas sampler and an image
 size of 512×768.
 Subject
 The subject is what you want to see in the image. A common mistake is not
 writing enough about the subjects.
 Let’s say we want to generate a sorceress casting magic. A newbie may write
 A sorceress
You get some decent images, but this prompt leaves too much room for
 imagination. (It is common to see the face garbled in Stable Diffusion. There are
 ways < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/common-problems-in-ai-images
and-how-to-fix-them/> to fix it.)
 How do you want the sorceress to look? Do you have any keywords to describe
 her more specifically? What does she wear? What kind of magic is she casting? Is
 she standing, running, or floating in the air? What’s the background scene?
 Stable Diffusion cannot read our minds. We have to say exactly what we want.
 As a demo, let’s say she is powerful and mysterious and uses lightning magic. She
 wears a leather outfit with gemstones. She sits down on a rock. She wears a hat.
 The background is a castle.
a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background
 Now, we generate more specific images. The outfit, the pose and the background
 are consistent across images.
 Medium
 Medium is the material used to make artwork. Some examples are illustration, oil
 painting, 3D rendering, and photography. Medium has a strong effect because one
 keyword alone can dramatically change the style.
Let’s add the keyword digital art.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art
 The images switched from a realistic painting style to being more like computer
 graphics. I think we can stop here. Just kidding.
Style
 The style refers to the artistic style of the image. Examples include impressionist,
 surrealist, pop art, etc.
 Add hyperrealistic, fantasy, dark art to the prompt.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art
 Now, the scene has become darker and more gloomy.
Art-sharing website
 Niche graphic websites such as Artstation < https://www.artstation.com> and
 Deviant Art < https://www.deviantart.com/> aggregate many images of
 distinct genres. Using them in a prompt is a sure way to steer the image toward
 these styles.
 Let’s add artstation to the prompt.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art, artstation
It’s not a huge change, but the images do look like what you would find on
 Artstation.
 Resolution
 Resolution represents how sharp and detailed the image is. Let’s add keywords
 highly detailed and sharp focus.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus
Well, it’s not a huge effect, perhaps because the previous images are already pretty
 sharp and detailed. But it doesn’t hurt to add.
 Additional details
 Additional details are sweeteners added to modify an image. We will add sci-fi and
 dystopian to add some vibe to the image.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus, sci-fi,
 dystopian
Color
 You can control the overall color of the image by adding color keywords. The
 colors you specified may appear as a tone or in objects.
 Let’s add some golden color to the image with the keyword iridescent gold.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus, sci-fi,
 dystopian, iridescent gold
The gold comes out great in a few places!
 Lighting
 Any photographer would tell you lighting is key to creating successful images.
 Lighting keywords can have a huge effect on how the image looks. Let’s add
 studio lighting to make it studio photo-like.
 a beautiful and powerful mysterious sorceress, smile, sitting on a
 rock, lightning magic, hat, detailed leather clothing with
 gemstones, dress, castle background, digital art, hyperrealistic,
 fantasy, dark art, artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus, sci-fi,
 dystopian, iridescent gold, studio lighting
This completes our example prompt.

art.com/standalone-prompt-generator>
 Remarks
 You may have noticed the images are already pretty good with only a few
 keywords added. More is not always better when building a prompt. You often
 don’t need many keywords to get good images.
 Negative prompt
 Using negative prompts < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-use
negative-prompts/> is another great way to steer the image, but instead of
 putting in what you want, you put in what you don’t want. They don’t need to be
 objects. They can also be styles and unwanted attributes. (e.g., ugly, deformed)
 Using negative prompts is a must for v2 models < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/models/#v2_models> . Without it, the images would look far inferior to
 v1’s. They are optional for v1 and SDXL < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/sdxl
model/> models, but I routinely use a boilerplate negative prompt because they
 either help or don’t hurt.
 I will use a simple universal negative prompt that doesn’t modify the style. You can
 read more < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-use-negative
prompts/> about it to understand how it works.
 disfigured, deformed, ugly
Process of building a good prompt
 Iterative prompt building
 You should approach prompt building as an iterative process. As the previous
 section shows, the images could be pretty good with just a few keywords added to
 the subject.
 I always start with a simple prompt with subject, medium, and style only. Generate
 at least 4 images at a time to see what you get. Most prompts do not work 100%
 of the time. You want to get some idea of what they can do statistically.
 Add at most two keywords at a time. Likewise, generate at least 4 images to assess
 its effect.
Using negative prompt
 You can use a universal negative prompt < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/how-to-use-negative-prompts/#Universal_negative_prompt> if you
 are starting out.
 Adding keywords to the negative prompt can be part of the iterative process. The
 keywords can be objects or body parts you want to avoid (Since v1 models are not
 very good at rendering hands, it’s not a bad idea to use “hand” in the negative
 prompt to hide them.)
 Prompting techniques
 You can modify a keyword’s importance by switching to a different one at a certain
 sampling step.
 The following syntaxes apply to AUTOMATIC1111 GUI. You can run this GUI with
 one click using the Colab notebook in the Quick Start Guide <
 https://andrewongai.gumroad.com/l/stable_diffusion_quick_start> . You can
 also install it on Windows < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install
windows/> and Mac < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-mac/> .
 Keyword weight
 (This syntax applies to AUTOMATIC1111 GUI.)
 You can adjust the weight of a keyword by the syntax (keyword: factor) .
 factor is a value such that less than 1 means less important and larger than 1
 means more important.
 For example, we can adjust the weight of the keyword dog in the following
 prompt
dog, autumn in paris, ornate, beautiful, atmosphere, vibe, mist,
 smoke, fire, chimney, rain, wet, pristine, puddles, melting,
 dripping, snow, creek, lush, ice, bridge, forest, roses, flowers, by
 stanley artgerm lau, greg rutkowski, thomas kindkade, alphonse
 mucha, loish, norman rockwell.
 (dog: 0.5)
 (dog: 0.5)
 dog
 dog
 (dog: 1.5)
 (dog: 1.5)
 Increasing the weight of dog tends to generate more dogs. Decreasing it tends to
 generate fewer. It is not always true for every single image. But it is true in a
 statistical sense.
 This technique can be applied to subject keywords and all categories, such as style
 and lighting.
 () and [] syntax
 (This syntax applies to AUTOMATIC1111 GUI.)
 An equivalent way to adjust keyword strength is to use () and [] . (keyword)
 increases the strength of the keyword by a factor of 1.1 and is the same as
 (keyword:1.1) . [keyword] decrease the strength by a factor of 0.9 and is the
 same as (keyword:0.9) .
You can use multiple of them, just like in Algebra… The effect is multiplicative.
 (keyword) is equivalent to (keyword: 1.1)
 ((keyword)) is equivalent to (keyword: 1.21)
 (((keyword))) is equivalent to (keyword: 1.33)
 Similarly, the effects of using multiple [] are:
 [keyword] is equivalent to (keyword: 0.9)
 [[keyword]] is equivalent to (keyword: 0.81)
 [[[keyword]]] is equivalent to (keyword: 0.73)
 AUTOMATIC1111 TIP: You can use Ctrl + Up/Down Arrow (Windows) or Cmd +
 Up/Down Arrow to increase/decrease the weight of a keyword.
 Keyword blending
 (This syntax applies to AUTOMATIC1111 GUI.)
 You can mix two keywords. The proper term is prompt scheduling. The syntax is
 [keyword1 : keyword2: factor]
 factor controls at which step keyword1 is switched to keyword2. It is a number
 between 0 and 1.
 For example, if I use the prompt
 Oil painting portrait of [Joe Biden: Donald Trump: 0.5]
 for 30 sampling steps.
 That means the prompt in steps 1 to 15 is
Oil painting portrait of Joe Biden
 And the prompt in steps 16 to 30 becomes
 Oil painting portrait of Donald Trump
 The factor determines when the keyword is changed. it is after 30 steps x 0.5 = 15
 steps.
 The effect of changing the factor is blending the two presidents to different
 degrees.
 You may have noticed Trump is in a white suit which is more of a Joe outfit. This is
 a perfect example of a very important rule for keyword blending: The first
 keyword dictates the global composition. The early diffusion steps set the
 overall composition. The later steps refine details.
 Quiz: What would you get if you swapped Donald Trump and Joe Biden?
 Blending faces
 A common use case is to create a new face with a particular look, borrowing from
 actors and actresses. For example, [Emma Watson: Amber heard: 0.85], 40 steps is
a look between the two:
 When carefully choosing the two names and adjusting the factor, we can get the
 look we want precisely.
 Alternatively, you can use multiple celebrity names with keyword weights to
 adjust facial features. For example:
 (Emma Watson:0.5), (Tara Reid:0.9), (Ana de Armas:1.2)
Blending 3 faces: (Emma Watson:0.5), (Tara Reid:0.9), (Ana de Armas:1.2)
 See this tutorial < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/consistent-face/> if you
 want to generate a consistent face across multiple images.
 Poor man’s prompt-to-prompt
 Using keyword blending, you can achieve effects similar to prompt-to-prompt <
 https://prompt-to-prompt.github.io/> , generating pairs of highly similar
 images with edits. The following two images are generated with the same prompt
 except for a prompt schedule to substitute apple with fire . The seed and
 number of steps were kept the same.
holding an [apple: fire: 0.9]
 holding an [apple: fire: 0.9]
 holding an [apple: fire: 0.2]
 holding an [apple: fire: 0.2]
 The factor needs to be carefully adjusted. How does it work? The theory behind
 this is the overall composition of the image was set by the early diffusion process
 < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion
work/#Diffusion_model> . Once the diffusion is trapped in a small space,
 swapping any keywords won’t have a large effect on the overall image. It would
 only change a small part.
 Consistent face
 Using multiple celebrity names is an easy way to blend two or more faces. The
 blending will be consistent across images. You don’t even need to use prompt
 scheduling. When you use multiple names, Stable Diffusion understands it as
 generating one person but with those facial features.
 The following phrase uses multiple names to blend three faces with different
 weights.
 (Emma Watson:0.5), (Tara Reid:0.9), (Ana de Armas:1.2)
 Putting this technique into action, the prompt is:
(Emma Watson:0.5), (Tara Reid:0.9), (Ana de Armas:1.2), photo of
 young woman, highlight hair, sitting outside restaurant, wearing
 dress, rim lighting, studio lighting, looking at the camera, dslr,
 ultra quality, sharp focus, tack sharp, dof, film grain, Fujifilm XT3,
 crystal clear, 8K UHD, highly detailed glossy eyes, high detailed
 skin, skin pores
 Here are images with the same prompt:
See this face repeating across the images!
 Use multiple celebrity names and keyword weights to carefully tune your desired
 facial feature. You can also use celebrity names in the negative prompt to avoid
 facial features you DON’T want.
 See more techniques to generate consistent faces < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/consistent-face/> .
 How long can a prompt be?
 Depending on what Stable Diffusion service you are using, there could be a
 maximum number of keywords you can use in the prompt. In the basic Stable
 Diffusion v1 model, that limit is 75 tokens.
 Note that tokens are not the same as words. The CLIP model < https://stable
diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/#Tokenizer> Stable Diffusion
 automatically converts the prompt into tokens, a numerical representation of
 words it knows. If you put in a word it has not seen before, it will be broken up into
2 or more sub-words until it knows what it is. The words it knows are called tokens,
 which are represented as numbers.
 For example, dream is one token and beach is another token. But dreambeach is
 two tokens because the model doesn’t know this word, and so the model breaks
 the word up to dream and beach which it knows.
 Prompt limit in AUTOMATIC1111
 AUTOMATIC1111 has no token limits <
 https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion
webui/wiki/Features#infinite-prompt-length> . If a prompt contains more than
 75 tokens, the limit of the CLIP tokenizer, it will start a new chunk of another 75
 tokens, so the new “limit” becomes 150. The process can continue forever or until
 your computer runs out of memory…
 Each chunk of 75 tokens is processed independently, and the resulting
 representations are concatenated before feeding into Stable Diffusion’s U-Net <
 https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion
work/#Feeding_embeddings_to_noise_predictor> .
 In AUTOMATIC1111, You can check the number of tokens by looking at the small
 box at the top right corner of the prompt input box.
Token counter in AUTOMATIC1111
 Starting a new prompt chunk
 What if you want to start a new prompt chunk before reaching 75 tokens?
 Sometimes you want to do that because the token in the beginning of a chunk can
 be more effective, and you may want to group related keywords in a chunk.
 You can use the keyword BREAK to start a chunk. The following prompt uses two
 chunks to specify the hat is white and the dress is blue.
 photo of a woman in white hat
 BREAK
 blue dress

Without the BREAK, Stable Diffusion is more likely to mix up the color of the hat
 and the dress.

Checking keywords
 The fact that you see people using a keyword doesn’t mean that it is effective. Like
 homework, we all copy each other’s prompts, sometimes without much thought.
 You can check the effectiveness of a keyword by just using it as a prompt. For
 example, does the v1.5 model know the American portrait painter John Singer
 Sargent < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singer_Sargent> ? Let’s check
 with the prompt
 John Singer Sargent
Positive!
 How about the Artstation sensation wlop < https://www.artstation.com/wlop>
 ?
 wlop
Well, doesn’t look like it. That’s why you shouldn’t use “by wlop”. That’s just adding
 noise.
 You can use this technique to examine the effect of mixing two or more artists.
 John Singer Sargent, Picasso
Limiting the variation
 To be good at building prompts, you need to think like Stable Diffusion. At its core,
 it is an image sampler, generating pixel values that we humans likely say it’s legit
 and good. You can even use it without prompts, and it would generate many
 unrelated images. In technical terms, this is called unconditioned or unguided
 diffusion.
 The prompt is a way to guide the diffusion process to the sampling space where it
 matches. I said earlier that a prompt needs to be detailed and specific. It’s because
a detailed prompt narrows down the sampling space. Let’s look at an example.
 castle
 castle, blue sky background
 wide angle view of castle, blue sky background
By adding more describing keywords in the prompt, we narrow down the sampling
 of castles. In We asked for any image of a castle in the first example. Then we
 asked to get only those with a blue sky background. Finally, we demanded it is
 taken as a wide-angle photo.
 The more you specify in the prompt, the less variation in the images.
 Association effect
 Attribute association
 Some attributes are strongly correlated. When you specify one, you will get the
 other. Stable Diffusion generates the most likely images that could have an
 unintended association effect.
 Let’s say we want to generate photos of women with blue eyes.
 a young female with blue eyes, highlights in hair, sitting outside
 restaurant, wearing a white outfit, side light
Blue eyes
 What if we change to brown eyes?
 a young female with brown eyes, highlights in hair, sitting
 outside restaurant, wearing a white outfit, side light
 Brown eyes
 Nowhere in the prompts, I specified ethnicity. But because people with blue eyes
 are predominantly Europeans, Caucasians were generated. Brown eyes are more
 common across different ethnicities, so you will see a more diverse sample of
 races.
Stereotyping and bias is a big topic in AI models. I will confine to the technical
 aspect in this article.
 Association of celebrity names
 Every keyword has some unintended associations. That’s especially true for
 celebrity names. Some actors and actresses like to be in certain poses or wear
 certain outfits when taking pictures, and hence in the training data. If you think
 about it, model training is nothing but learning by association. If Taylor Swift (in
 the training data) always crosses her legs, the model would think leg crossing is
 Taylor Swift too.
 Prompt: full body taylor swift in future high tech dystopian city, digital painting
 When you use Taylor Swift in the prompt, you may mean to use her face. But
 there’s an effect of the subject’s pose and outfit too. The effect can be studied by
 using her name alone as the prompt.
 Poses and outfits are global compositions. If you want her face but not her poses,
 you can use keyword blending to swap her in at a later sampling step.
Association of artist names
 Perhaps the most prominent example of association is seen when using artist
 names.
 The 19th-century Czech painter Alphonse Mucha is a popular occurrence in
 portrait prompts because the name helps generate interesting embellishments,
 and his style blends very well with digital illustrations. But it also often leaves a
 signature circular or dome-shaped pattern in the background. They could look
 unnatural in outdoor settings.
 Prompt: digital painting of [Emma Watson:Taylor Swift: 0.6] by Alphonse Mucha. (30 steps)
 Embeddings are keywords
 Embeddings < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/embedding/> , the result of
 textual inversion, are nothing but combinations of keywords. You can expect them
 to do a bit more than what they claim.
Let’s see the following base images of Ironman making a meal without using
 embeddings.
 Prompt: iron man cooking in kitchen.
 Style-Empire < https://civitai.com/models/2032/empire-style> is an
 embedding I like to use because it adds a dark tone to portrait images and creates
 an interesting lighting effect. Since it was trained on an image with a street scene
 at night, you can expect it adds some blacks AND perhaps buildings and streets.
 See the images below with the embedding added.
Prompt: iron man cooking in kitchen Style-Empire.
 Note some interesting effects
 The background of the first image changed to city buildings at night.
 Iron man tends to show his face. Perhaps the training image is a portrait?
 So even if an embedding is intended to modify the style, it is just a bunch of
 keywords and can have unintended effects.
 Effect of custom models
 Using a custom model < https://stable-diffusion-art.com/models/> is the
 easiest way to achieve a style, guaranteed. This is also a unique charm of Stable
Diffusion. Because of the large open-source community, thousands of custom
 models are freely available.
 When using a model, we need to be aware that the meaning of a keyword can
 change. This is especially true for styles.
 Let’s use John Singer Sargent as the prompt with the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model.
Using the DreamShaper < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/models/#DreamShaper> with the same prompt, a model fine-tuned for
 realistic portrait illustrations, we get the following images instead.
The style becomes more realistic. The DreamShaper model has a strong basis for
 generating clear and pretty woman faces.
 Check before you use a style in a custom model. van Gogh may not be van Gogh
 anymore!
 Region-specific prompts
 Do you know you can specify different prompts for different regions of the image?
For example, you can put the moon at the top left:
 Or at the top right:
You can do that by using the Regional Prompter < https://stable-diffusion
art.com/regional-prompter/> extension. It’s a great way to control image
 composition!

 Great article. One thing I’m struggling with is controlling the face direction. Can be
 hit or miss though not sure it’s actually using any of my suggestions or just after a
 number of generations the head is in the appropriate direction. Example if I want
 the subject to be facing the camera and the head looking up, don’t seem to have
 the magic sauce to make it do that. Thoughts?

 want to see the right/upper right side of my object?

Lol. Using the same actress 11 times is to limit the randomisation of the output,
 and isolate the prompt variables impact he’s teaching. You really chose to rant
 about something you know nothing about, and assume things about someone you
 know nothing about. Repulsive….

 misogyny???????? Dude… if it was about a guy you would have nothing to say.
 misogyny is about a guy making a girl feel less. but apricating her. if this misogyny
 then all guys should just burn out their eyes….

Thanks for the tutorial, but why all the misogyny?
 “We get Emma Watson 11 out of 10 times. Her name is such a strong effect on the
 model. I think she’s popular among Stable Diffusion users because she looks
 decent, young, and consistent across a wide range of scenes. Trust me, we cannot
 say the same for all actresses, especially the ones who have been active in the 90s
 or earlier…”
 We get Emma Watson because her identity is constantly stolen for pornographic
 purposes—look up deepfake porn, her identity is stolen more than any other
 celebrity. And why the 90s reference with the ellipsis? Why rag on women who are
 30 years or older? Why are you afraid of older looking women? Emma Watson is
 33 years old.
 This is useful information, but it’s so discouraging to see misogyny rampant in the
 AI community.

 This guy gives all the answers to the test, and your biggest issue is he used more
 women? Well if it helps, the artistic representation of women is a more difficult test
 to the AI than of men; now, if you want to make it more in your fashion then why
 don’t you make a few models, LoRA’s or what have you, and develop them in the
 other direction than complain about the examples in the subject matter.

My comment was on technical aspect of Stable Diffusion v1.5 model. It has
 something to do with the timing of training and perhaps bias in training data that
 she looks exceptionally good among all actresses.
 I don’t watch deep fake porns so I don’t know how common her identity got
 stolen. But I think it is irrelevant to why she stands out so well in the model.

 It’s an effect that multiplies the keyword by 1.1 in the case of ( ) and by .9 in [ ]. For
 example (dog) is same as (dog:1.1) but shorter, so If you would like more dog
 increased 10% to the actual value you can just ((dog)) instead of (dog:1.21) and
 calculate faster. Same concept with [ ], [dog] == (dog:0.9) and also [[dog]] ==
 (dog:0.81)

 Let’s see if I can help explain syntax another way using the same example Andrew
 gives. (No offence Andrew. I love you stuff and it really helps me enormously.
 Great work)
 Ok let’s say you wanted to create an image looking like a “painting of Paris by
 Norman Rockwell”. Andrew gives us the whole prompt with many artists etc – but
 for the sake of simplicity I’m going to narrow it down to 5 keywords but try to
 keep the feeling. We are going to try to manipulate the “dog” keyword.
 > dog, autumn in paris, mist, rain, by norman rockwell.
When I run this I usually get one dog but some times more. We’re saying that the
 factor of this keyword as it stands alone is 1. by Factor we mean the strength of
 that keyword on the creation of the image. For my own peace of mind I imagine
 that the factors range of influence can go from 0 to 2. e.g. a weight of 0 would
 mean that the keyword has no influence at all. However in practice I’ve been told
 0.5 to 1.5 are the useful factors before it starts to break the process. Experiment at
 leisure.
 Ok back to “dog”.
 > dog, autumn in paris, mist, rain, by norman rockwell.
 Let’s say I want the “dog” keyword to be MORE influential because I want more
 dogs appearing in my image. You could do the same with “rain”. To make the
 factor of dog increase I could put curved brackets around it. Everytime I put an
 additional pair around the keyword it would increase it’s influence by 0.1 or 10%.
 So if I wanted dog to have a factor of 1.2 I would put two pairs of curved brackets
 around it and write:
 > ((dog)), autumn in paris, mist, rain, by norman rockwell.
 Let’s say I now want “mist” keyword to be LESS influential because I want to see
 further in my image. To make the factor of mist decrease I could put square
 brackets around it. Every time I put an additional pair around the keyword it would
 decrease it’s influence by 0.1 or 10%. So if I wanted mist to have a factor of 0.7 (or
 30% less effective) I would put three pairs of square brackets around it and write:
 > ((dog)), autumn in paris, [[[mist]]], rain, by norman rockwell.
 Alternatively, you can also write the factor by placing the keyword in curved
 brackets and writing the factor after the keyword separated by a colon “:”
 character. e.g. our example would look like:
 > (dog:1.2), autumn in paris, (mist:0.7), rain, by norman rockwell.
 Hope that helps.
 Let me know if I got any wrong

 Whatever AI I use, if I want the photo to start from a photo of me that I upload
 online, then the result is that the face, height, or everything of the subject of the
 photo I uploaded always changes. How to NOT change the subject but maybe just
 the landscape, or clothing?
 Andrew
 < https://stable-diffusion-art.com>
 May 6, 2023 at 11:22 am
This cannot be done with prompt alone. You can use inpainting to change just a
 part of the image, e.g. clothing and background.

 Halaster
 April 19, 2023 at 2:51 am
 Thanks for the reply. Yeah, Inpainting right now is generally how I fix the issue as
 its easy to handle that way. I just wanted to check if I was missing something or if
 there was a way to get it to actually associate colors more accurately without
 requiring the extra steps. Some character or some prompt type I did not know
 about like an underscore between words or something. Since sometimes the color
 bleed is really bad, completely altering the entire composition, which makes
 inpainting a bit more work.
Halaster
 April 17, 2023 at 3:44 am
 Is there a way to get colors to follow specific guides, for example, in your prompt
 when you asked for Blue eyes and a White dress you ended up with blue applying
 to both the eyes AND the dress, with the dress completely ignoring your specified
 color. Any time I specify two different colors I can almost never get it to actually do
 what I want. If I ask for say a purple top and white pants, 90% of the time I will end
 up with either everything purple, or everything white, or with purple pants and
 white top instead, doing the opposite of what I asked. On top of that all sorts of
 other objects in the image will be changed to purple or white. I could say a woman
 sitting under a waterfall in a white top with purple pants and ill end up with a
 woman sitting under a purple waterfall, with half the rocks being purple, and a
 purple top. Even if I specifically group and add weights to things. So a woman
 sitting under a waterfall in a (purple top), and (white pants:1.4). The colors will
 STILL almost always ignore what I am specifying. Even if I run a script to test this
 same prompt across 20 different models of all varieties, it will be messed up in
 every single model. Am I missing something on how to directly tie the aspect of a
 color to a specific part of the image? Thanks.

 I think this is a limitation of v1 models. The language model is simply not good
 enough to deal with the complexity. You can try v2.1 models.
Alternatively, make your creation a multi-step process. Correct the color with
 inpainting.
 KlaysMoji

 Use img2img for that! Draw a crude composition in a drawing software of the
 things you want colored the way you want, and send it to Stable’s Diffusion’s
 img2img feature with a strength of like 95. If that doesn’t work, use a strength of
 60 to get something awful, then reinsert it again with a strength of 60, over and
 over, until you get a picture that matches your colors.
 If you don’t know how to compose it, just get your generation that will be wrong,
 and crudely paint over the elements with the color that you want them, and do the
 above steps. I recommend this method over inpainting because all the time
 img2img gives me better results than whatever I was generating initially, the more
 times a picture is sent through img2img the better it gets, and you can even
 change the prompt between passes for best results.
 Sometimes I get something that leaves me in awe and think “this is it”, because it
 doesn’t even look like something generated by AI anymore. And I’m talking about
 sending an image 20 times through img2img, changing prompts, copying over
 pieces of old generations that were the best (which can be done crudely) and
 using the next img2img to make them blend in. And, of course, using img2img
 with different models.
 SD1.5 isn’t good at composition, anime models like Anything V4 (from dezgo)
 make great compositions, but then everyone looks the same, but you can send
 them to img2img to a model like Epic Diffusion and get great output. I’ve been
 unable to draw certain things no matter what prompts I use, but can produce them
in Anything V4 and then use img2img to redraw them in more varied styles,
 specially, Anything V4 can do good photorealism too, all you need to do is fix the
 anime face (because once it’s in the picture SD recognizes it even if no prompt will
 produce it.)
 As a last tip, if you’re generating cartoons, try adding “by KlaysMoji” at the
 beginning of your list of artists to give them a nice spin ?

 This is an excellent tutorial, thank you for sharing.
 One thing I noticed was that when I introduced the negative prompts, the images
 produced had multiple faces. Emma Watson’s face and head had another Emma
 Watson face and head on the original one. Some images had two faces and bodies
 merged/intertwined.

 Hi, it should have more to do with the size of the image. The native resolution of
 SD v1 is 512×512. It will generate two heads or bodies if you deviates too much
 from it.
